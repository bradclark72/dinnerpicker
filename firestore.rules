/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Random Eats application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data, identified by their unique Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * User profiles are stored in the `/users/{userId}` collection, where `{userId}` matches the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - All write operations require a verified, authenticated user.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototype to allow flexible data shapes.

     * @allow (create) - Authenticated user creates their own profile with matching UID.
     * @allow (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user accesses their own profile with matching UID.
     * @deny (create) - Non-authenticated user attempts to create a profile.
     * @deny (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user attempts to access another user's profile (UID mismatch).
     * @deny (list) - Listing all users is forbidden.
     * @principle Enforces strict user ownership for all operations.
