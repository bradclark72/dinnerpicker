/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Random Eats application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all user data. Each user can only access their own data, and no other users' data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID of the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All writes are validated against the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's `id` field.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `isPremium` and `picksUsed` flags are denormalized directly onto the `/users/{userId}` document to avoid costly `get()` calls during authorization.

     * @deny (create) - An unauthenticated user cannot create a user document.
     * @deny (create) - An authenticated user cannot create a document with an `id` that doesn't match their `auth.uid`.
     * @deny (get) - An unauthenticated user cannot read any user document.
     * @deny (get) - An authenticated user cannot read another user's document.
     * @deny (update) - An unauthenticated user cannot update any user document.
     * @deny (update) - An authenticated user cannot update another user's document.
     * @deny (delete) - An unauthenticated user cannot delete any user document.
     * @deny (delete) - An authenticated user cannot delete another user's document.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
